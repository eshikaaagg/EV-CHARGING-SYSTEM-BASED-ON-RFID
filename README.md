# EV-CHARGING-SYSTEM-BASED-ON-RFID
Overview

This project implements an EV Charging System using RFID authentication to allow only registered vehicles to access charging stations within their locality. This helps prevent overloading and crowding at charging stations. Additionally, the system provides an option for unregistered users to find the nearest available charging station in case of emergencies.

Features

RFID-Based Access Control: Only registered vehicles can use the charging station.

Locality-Based Authentication: Users can access charging stations only in their designated area.

Overload Prevention: Controls the number of vehicles charging at a time.

Emergency Access Mode: Unregistered users can locate the nearest charging station.

User Dashboard: Displays real-time charging status and station availability.
